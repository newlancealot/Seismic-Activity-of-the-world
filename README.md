## Background

Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

## My Chart

The Dashboard I created will display the seismic activity of the world for the last 7 days. This chart will update every 5 min as USGS updates their files. 

Consider the following when reviewing the map

* Markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in its size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and darker in color. 
* Tetonic Plates are represented by black lines
* Tetonic plate data and earthquake data can be toggled on or off. 
* The map has two layers, a Satellite View and a Darken Sat. View.
